# NBA-Salaries

As an introduction to machine learning and predictive analytics, I developed a model to predict NBA salaries based on individual player statistical trends. I obtained player performance data from NBA.com for all NBA players from 2010 to 2021. Player salary data was sourced from Basketball Reference. After using Excel and Python to analyze two data sets extracted from NBA.com, the model proved to be 80% accurate after testing. One possible application for this type of model is in professional athlete salary negotiations.
